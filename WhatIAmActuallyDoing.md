rpm17 has a borg installed natively. No stupid docker or vm bullshit.

the previous hot spare has been commandeered for the repo folder. seems to fit at the moment. obviously a bit crazy that the backup, on one disk, is less safe than the source data. time will tell. I can also just buy a bigger disk if it doesnt all fit. I have one more bay left after all. and rather than buying some shitty enclosure why not use the bay?

it remains to be seen how this works with vorta on the macs, and in general in server mode if i try backing up my server stuff from prox.local
